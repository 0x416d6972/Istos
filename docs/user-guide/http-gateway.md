# HTTP Gateway, Health Probes & Metrics

Istos speaks Zenoh natively, but real deployments also need an HTTP surface:
non-Zenoh callers (a FastAPI frontend, a browser, an external partner) have to
reach your services, Kubernetes needs HTTP health probes, and Prometheus needs a
scrape endpoint. One embedded server provides all three.

Enable it with a port:

```python
from istos import Istos

app = Istos(http_port=8080)
```

That starts an aiohttp server exposing:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /livez`, `GET /healthz` | liveness probe (process is up) |
| `GET /readyz` | readiness probe (200 when ready, 503 otherwise) |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus text-format metrics |
| your gateway routes | HTTP → handler bridge (below) |
| WebSocket routes | `@channel(..., ws=…)` — see [Channels](channels.md) |
| `/mcp` | MCP tools when `enable_mcp=True` (below) |

## HTTP ingress gateway (call Istos from FastAPI, browsers, curl)

Mark a handler with `http=` and it's reachable over HTTP as well as Zenoh:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from istos import Istos, Principal, Depends, current_principal

app = Istos(http_port=8080, authorizer=my_authorizer)

class MoveRequest(BaseModel):
    distance: int

@app.handle("robot/move", http=True)   # POST /robot/move
async def move(req: MoveRequest, user: Principal = Depends(current_principal)):
    return {"moved": req.distance, "by": user.id}
```

Now any HTTP client can call it:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/robot/move \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -d '{"distance": 5}'
```

Under the hood the request is translated into a **Zenoh query** against
`robot/move`, so it runs through the *entire* handler pipeline — authorization,
validation, DI, middleware — with nothing bypassed. Query-string params and a
JSON body are **merged** into the handler kwargs (body wins on key clashes).
JSON replies go out as `application/json`; non-JSON payloads use
`application/octet-stream`.

`http=` forms:

- `http=True` → `POST /<prefix>`
- `http="GET /things"` → explicit method + path
- `http="/custom/path"` → `POST /custom/path`

### Auth is forwarded

The HTTP `Authorization` header is passed through as the Zenoh query
**attachment** — exactly where the authorizer reads the token (`current_token`).
So your authorizer gate and `Principal` work across the HTTP boundary: a request
with no/invalid token is denied with the mapped HTTP status, and a valid one
injects the resolved identity into the handler.

Error / miss → HTTP status:

| Situation | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `unauthorized` | 401 |
| `forbidden` | 403 |
| `not_found` | 404 |
| `validation_error` / `bad_request` | 400 |
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | 429 |
| Upstream query raised (`gateway_error`) | 502 |
| Handler never replied / empty get | 504 |
| Other error envelopes | 500 |

### Calling Istos from FastAPI

Because it's just HTTP, a FastAPI service needs no Zenoh dependency:

```python
# In the FastAPI app — plain HTTP client:
async def move_robot(token: str):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as c:
        r = await c.post("http://istos-node:8080/robot/move",
                         json={"distance": 5},
                         headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
        return r.json()
```

!!! note "HTTP interop, not fabric membership"
    The gateway lets external callers *invoke* Istos handlers over HTTP. It does
    not make them Zenoh peers — they don't join the brokerless pub/sub fabric or
    get durable replay. If the other service is Python and you want full fabric
    membership (pub/sub, durability), embed the Zenoh client directly instead of
    going through HTTP.

### Co-hosting inside FastAPI (one process)

The gateway above is one process talking to another. For an API gateway that
*is* the mesh, run Istos inside the FastAPI process and let FastAPI own the HTTP
port. `istos.asgi.lifespan` opens the Zenoh session on startup and closes it on
shutdown; your routes then reach the whole mesh in-process — no sidecar, no
second port:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from istos import Istos
from istos.communication.config import IstosZenohConfig
from istos.asgi import lifespan

mesh = Istos(
    config=IstosZenohConfig(
        mode="peer", connect_endpoints=["tls/svc-a.internal:7447"],
        multicast_scouting=False, enable_mtls=True,
        root_ca_certificate="/etc/istos/ca.pem",
        listen_certificate="/etc/istos/gateway.pem",
        listen_private_key="/etc/istos/gateway.key",
    ),
    authorizer=jwt, require_auth=True,
)
api = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan(mesh))

@api.post("/robot/move")
async def move(distance: int, principal=Depends(authenticate)):
    return await mesh.query_once("robot/move", distance=distance)

@api.get("/llm/generate")
async def generate(prompt: str):
    async def tokens():
        async for t in mesh.stream_query("llm/generate", prompt=prompt):
            yield f"data: {t}\n\n"
    return StreamingResponse(tokens(), media_type="text/event-stream")
```

Here FastAPI authenticates the north-south HTTP request, and the mesh call is
in-process. `lifespan(mesh)` uses `mesh.serving()` with **`serve_http=False`**
so uvicorn owns the port. If you already have your own lifespan, wrap
`async with mesh.serving():` around your `yield` instead of using the helper.

Pass `serve_http=True` only when you deliberately want the embedded aiohttp
surface *and* ASGI in the same process (two HTTP servers — usually a mistake).

!!! warning "Edge auth does not secure the fabric"
    Authenticating at the FastAPI edge only controls who reaches your HTTP
    routes. It does **not** protect the Zenoh mesh: a co-hosted node in the
    default `peer` mode with multicast scouting can still be discovered and
    invoked directly by any other peer on the network segment, bypassing FastAPI
    entirely. Secure the fabric itself — mTLS + `multicast_scouting=False` on
    `IstosZenohConfig` (still brokerless, no router) plus an app-wide `authorizer`
    with `require_auth=True`. See [Security](security.md).

### Streaming over HTTP (Server-Sent Events)

A `@stream` handler emits many chunks over one call — ideal for SLM/LLM token
streaming. Mark it with `http=` and the gateway bridges it to
`text/event-stream` (SSE), so a browser `EventSource` or a FastAPI proxy can
consume the tokens live:

```python
@app.stream("llm/generate", http=True)          # GET /llm/generate
async def generate(prompt: str):
    async for token in model.stream(prompt):
        yield token
```

Each yielded chunk becomes one SSE `data:` frame; the stream closes with an
`event: end` frame, or `event: error` carrying `{code, message}` if the handler
raises. SSE routes default to **`GET`** (what `EventSource` uses); pass an
explicit method to override (`http="POST /generate"`). `http_timeout_s` bounds
the whole stream (default 60s for long inference).

```javascript
// In the browser — no Zenoh, no framework:
const es = new EventSource("http://istos-node:8080/llm/generate?prompt=hello");
es.onmessage = (e) => append(e.data);            // each token
es.addEventListener("end",   () => es.close());
es.addEventListener("error", (e) => es.close());
```

The `Authorization` header and W3C trace headers (`traceparent`,
`X-Correlation-ID`) cross into the Zenoh envelope just as for one-shot routes, so
the stream's authorizer gate runs and correlation/trace propagate from the HTTP
edge. Responses include `X-Accel-Buffering: no` so nginx does not buffer the
stream. Consuming a stream **inside** the fabric (Python peer) still uses
[`stream_query`](rpc.md); SSE is the external-caller path.

## Kubernetes health probes

Point the kubelet at the HTTP probes:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet: { path: /livez, port: 8080 }
readinessProbe:
  httpGet: { path: /readyz, port: 8080 }
```

`/readyz` returns 503 until the service has finished binding its handlers and
subscribers (and returns 503 again during shutdown), so Kubernetes only routes
traffic when the node is actually ready. Register custom readiness checks with
`app.add_health_check(name, check)` and they are reported in the `/readyz` body.

## Metrics

`GET /metrics` returns the built-in `MetricsCollector` in Prometheus text format
(request counts and latency histograms via the `PrometheusMiddleware`). Scrape it
directly — no extra dependency required.

## MCP tools

`Istos(enable_mcp=True)` exposes `@handle` endpoints as MCP tools at `/mcp`.

limits): [MCP tools](mcp.md).
